## 🌍 The Mission
Vauntico is building the world's first **Self-Healing Creator OS** and **Financial TrustScore Framework**. Our mission is to bridge the global "Trust Gap," enabling creators in emerging markets—starting in Africa—to access sustainable, scalable, and borderless income.

This repository houses the **Fulfillment Engine**: the autonomous backbone ensuring digital products reach global customers instantly and securely.

## 👻 The Phantom Maintainer (Self-Healing)
This infrastructure is managed by a headless, autonomous cloud agent designed for a "Permanent Green" state.
- **Intent-First Development:** We manage the codebase via "Intent" declarations in GitHub Issues.
- **Shadow Repo Execution:** The system spins up isolated environments to write, test, and verify code before deployment.
- **Autonomous Hygiene:** Nightly scans for "Dependency Rot" and "Stale Logic" ensure the system heals while the team is offline.

## 🚀 Core Features
- **Universal Fulfillment:** Automated digital asset delivery via Airtable & Resend.
- **Financial TrustScore:** (Core Mission) A proprietary framework to quantify and verify creator reliability for global financial integration.
- **Data Integrity:** Integrated **RLS (Row-Level Security) Guardian** to ensure absolute privacy and financial security.
